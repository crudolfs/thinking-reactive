## Useful scenarios Front-End
- Processing mouse movement and clicks
- keyboard typing
- GPS signals over time
- touch events

---
## Useful scenarios Back-End
- Processing any latency-bound IO events from disk or network (IO is inherently asynchronous)
- Handling system events from a server
- Events triggered from sensors
- Streaming data to front-ends (WebSockets or Server Sent Events)
